Students will study German history, politics and society through legal cases represented in Fritz Lang\u0092s M (1931), Erich Engel\u0092s The Blum Affair (1948), Kurt Maetzig\u0092s The Rabbit Is Me (1965), Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff\u0092s adaption of Kleist\u0092s novel Michael Kohlhaas (1969), Uli Edel\u0092s The Baader Meinhof Complex (2008), Margarethe von Trotta\u0092s Hannah Arendt (2012), Giulio Ricciarelli\u0092s Labyrinth of Lies (2014), and Ferdinand von Schirach\u0092s Terror (2015). Through studying these narratives, the students will gain a richer understanding of crucial events and periods in German history, e.g., the terrorist campaign of the Red Army Faction in the 1970s, and will develop a comprehensive understanding of the dialectical relationship between crime and justice in a specifically German context."}, {"Time And Days": "", "Course Title": "Senior Seminar", "Room Location": "", "Additional Course Info": "Class Number: 1977\nSenior Seminar.
