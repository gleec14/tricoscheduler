We are constantly engaging ideas about\ngender, race, class, sexuality, and the connections between them.

Yet we also can\u0092t get enough of celebrities, who\ncontinue to attract attention, sell products, and champion the social\ngood. This seminar explores how different media\u0097print, photography,\nfilm, television, and the Internet\u0097have given rise to changing forms\nof celebrity. We will investigate both the underlying bases of\ncelebrity and the varied cultural, artistic, and economic functions\nthat this kind of fame performs. Our overarching focus will be how\ncelebrities and celebrity-hood shape the public sphere and our\ncollective discourse. Texts and topics of inquiry might include:\nlate-Victorian celebrity Oscar Wilde\u0092s novel The Picture of Dorian\nGray; glamour and star-making in the golden age of Hollywood;\nrhetorics of privacy and visibility during the Cold War; cultures of\nfandom; Lauren Berlant\u0092s take on \u0093Diva Citizenship\u0094; celebrity\npoliticians; and fame in the era of Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter.\nWe will develop conceptual questions and arguments through close\nreadings, engaged discussions, short essays, the revision process, and\nclassroom presentations.", "Registration ID": "EMLYB001015", "Miscellaneous Links": "Departmental Homepage\nBook Prices", "Credit": "1.00", "Semester": "Fall_2017", "Lab Sections": "", "Department": "Emily Balch Seminars", "Instructor": "Bryant,Sara Louise", "CRN": "2613", "Campus": "Bryn_Mawr", "Description": "The Balch Seminars introduce all first-year students at Bryn Mawr to a critical, probing, thoughtful approach to the world and our roles in it.

In this class, we consider\nthe encounter between democracy and terror by exploring the deep\nhistory of the politics of fear, including the Terror of the French\nRevolution, colonialism and guerilla warfare in Africa and India, and\nracial violence in the American south. We will pay special attention\nto the rhetoric of terror\u0097that is, how different writers inspire or\nreact to anxieties relating to religion, race, and sexuality. Topics\naddressed in this seminar include torture, borders, suicide bombing,\nsurveillance, Islamophobia, religion and secularism, and insurgency\nand warfare.

This course\nexamines these questions through study of the early stages of\narchitectural development on Bryn Mawr\u0092s campus. In particular, we\nexplore the ways in which the founders of Bryn Mawr understood\narchitecture as a key aspect of the institution\u0092s image and\naspirations. We consider Bryn Mawr\u0092s High Victorian Gothic and\nCollegiate Gothic buildings in relation to nineteenth-century debates\nsurrounding the acceptability and appropriate nature of women\u0092s higher\neducation; trends in architectural styles at the other women\u0092s\ncolleges established in England and the United States at this time;\nand the ways in which M.

Readings will include\nnineteenth-century letters, architectural treatises, and institutional\ndocuments as well as literary works such as Alfred, Lord Tennyson\u0092s\n\u0093The Princess\u0094 (1847) and Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u0092s \u0093The Yellow\nWallpaper\u0094 (1892).

What makes us laugh? Analyzing trends in humor, from late-night\ntalk shows to Broad City and Two Dope Queens, we ask, Who gets to be\nfunny? And how do comedians, technicians of laughter, relate to\nsociety and conceive of their own vocations? How, in fact, is a\ncomedian a critic, contributing to public discourse and civility? From\nthere, we proceed to larger, complex questions: How does laughter help\nto shape cultural norms and national dialogue? How has humor, in\ncertain proximity to larger advocacy movements, advanced racial\nequality and LGBTQ rights? In the current political climate, what role\ndoes humor serve? What is the power of comedy? What is its limitation?\nAnd how do political ideologies use comedy to promote or discredit\nstances on contested issues like race, gender and class? Through\ncritical examination, guided by rhetoricians like Kenneth Burke and\nthe dramatistic theory of rhetoric, we\u0092ll consider what the function\nof satire is in a democratic society. We\u0092ll think, too, about what it\nmeans to deploy humor not just as a style or genre but as an attitude,\nas a way of reframing\u0097and perhaps even remaking\u0097the reality we inhabit\nand create. In order to give shape to the discourse surrounding\ncomedy, we\u0092ll examine written comedic texts, as well as audio podcasts\nand excerpts from television.

The primary focus of the seminar will be evaluating the degree of correspondence between the cinematic presentation and current research knowledge about the disorder, taking into account the historical period in which the film was made.  For example, we will discuss how accurately the symptoms of the disorder are presented and how representative the protagonist is of people who typically manifest this disorder based on current research. We will also address the theory of etiology of the disorder depicted in the film, including discussion of the relevant intellectual history in the period when the film was made and the prevailing accounts of psychopathology in that period. Another focus will be how the film portrays the course of the disorder and how it depicts treatment for the disorder. This cinematic presentation will be evaluated with respect to current research on treatment for the disorder as well as the historical context of prevailing treatment for the disorder at the time the film was made.
