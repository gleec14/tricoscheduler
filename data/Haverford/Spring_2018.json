We turn to a collection of country songs, analyzing their messages and receptions. We read several novels and one disability memoir to explore how these assumptions are mobilized and resisted.

Though it's a truism that race, class, and gender are co-determinants, both the media and scholarship still manage to assume (more often than not) that the working-class is white, straight, and male. This course begins by examining the historical roots of this pervasive assumption, both via primary and scholarly sources. We turn to a collection of country songs, analyzing their messages and receptions. We read several novels and one disability memoir to explore how these assumptions are mobilized and resisted.
