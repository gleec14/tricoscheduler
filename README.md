Description
---
Trico Auto Scheduler allows students from the Tri-Co to generate their schedules
for the semester. Students can select a list of classes they are interested in
and this generator will suggest the best combination(s). As a long term goal,
the generator should provide a possible schedule based on information about the
user and previous experiences from other students.
